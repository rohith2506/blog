A few weeks ago, someone pointed out to me that India is now the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing the U.K. They asked me how I feel about it, and I thought that a one-word response would not do justice, hence this blog post.

It's been six years since I left India, and a lot has changed since then. There has been more globalization, rapid economic growth, and major infrastructure projects, resulting in a growing wealth gap. The cost of living in cities like Hyderabad and Bangalore is now comparable to that of Amsterdam and Paris. The standard of living, as measured by income, is now on par with top Western societies. While this should be cause for celebration, I find myself feeling more afraid of this rapid growth than ever.

For my fellow Indians, every time you visit a nice caf√© or travel in your luxurious vehicle, you may have seen women and men walking barefoot in the scorching sun, sometimes carrying a crying baby or physically disabled, asking for spare change. While this may seem like a small inconvenience to you, for them it could mean meals for one or two days. I do not mean to guilt trip anyone, as we have grown accustomed to these scenes since childhood and are trained to ignore most of them, as there is only so much we can do. After all, 60% of the country still lives below the poverty line.

Along with the staggering economic growth, there is a noticeable wealth gap between the rich and poor. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are becoming poorer, with many lacking a safety net. They scrape by on what little is left, sometimes going hungry. This is not just the poverty that we see on the streets, but also those who may be dressed comfortably but are struggling with hunger and melancholy. I call this "invisible poverty."

My mother tries her best to help some of these families, and I have personally seen the effects of invisible poverty twice in the past 24 hours. A widowed mother who cleans dishes from house to house for just 120 euros per month, only to be abused by her 16-year-old son for his drinking habits, and a father whose son has severe intellectual disabilities and bipolar disorder, but with no resources or knowledge on how to get treatment, earning only 150 euros per month.

When this wealth gap becomes too wide, it can erode the moral foundations that keep our civilization stable. My brother told me that the crime rate in Nellore has doubled in recent years, largely due to invisible poverty.

This is not just another post pointing out problems and offering solutions, as if no one else is smart enough to do so. The problem is simple, but the solutions are complex, specific to geographic locations, and require the cooperation of multiple institutions and groups over a long period of time. All I ask is that if you are in a position to share your wealth or income with others, please do so. You don't have to donate to the homeless or beggars, you can start in your own backyard. Look around you. The maid who cleans your house but can't pay her rent, the security guard who can't afford to educate his children. Just pay attention

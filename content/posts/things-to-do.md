Instead of setting yearly resolutions, I’ve decided to focus on something more meaningful—a growing list of experiences and moments I want to embrace in my lifetime. This isn’t a rigid or exhaustive list; it’s a living document that will evolve as I do. Each item represents a step toward living fully, and as I complete them, I’ll strike them off and share the story behind the experience.

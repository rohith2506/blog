In the upcoming year, I won't be taking up any new hobbies due to my startup and other commitments, which will keep me busy. However, I plan to travel more and try out some unique experiences as the year progresses. My motto remains unchanged from the previous year: "The unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day."

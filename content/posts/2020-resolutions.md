As the title suggests, this is yet another resolutions blog post. Seems like I am quite late to the party. This should have been done a month ago but **better late than never.**

Research suggests that publicly committing to your goals will hold you accountable. So, that self inflicted fear of losing in front of everyone will push you hard.

I will divide my goals into objectives and each one will be divided into milestones to see how far I have reached. 0.3 represents the fair goal, 0.7 means moderate while 1.0 means going crazy.


## Objective 1: Build a profitable (or) valuable side project  

It's been almost five years since I started to build things in different organizations. More and more I do it, I realise that the best way I can utilize my skills 100% is to start something on my own.


The first step is to understand different markets and businesses and see where I can be of help. And also, I would like to satisfy the little engineer in me by solving interesting and challenging problems as I go.


> * Build a side project which generates revenue on the side. This will teach me how to be an independent entrepreneur.
>    * Build a side project and launch it to the public (0.3)
>    * Make the business model break even (0.7)
>    * Generate profits even though itâ€™s small (1.0)




## Objective 2: Transition myself into large scale machine learning

Despite all the hype going around deep learning, ( Don't worry people, robots are not gonna take your **creative** jobs anytime soon. We are too far away from [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)), I have developed an enormous amount of curiosity around Machine learning and things which are possible with it.

Even though we could never build a general conscious machine which thinks like humans anytime soon, We can build advanced machines which can do deterministic tasks given enough training data without any issue and I would like to contribute to this research.

I would like to mix my experience working of large scale systems with machine learning and build interesting and valuable products.



> * Become proficient in large scale machine learning
>    * Build a side project which has heavy emphasis on machine learning
>    * Get visible on Machine Learning community
>        * Maintaining an active blog with emphasis on machine learning technical posts (0.3)
>        * Presenting a technical talk on machine learning at a local meetup (0.7)
>        * Presenting a technical talk on machine learning at an international conference (1.0)


## Objective 3: Get better at mobility and flexibility while maintaining the same strength

It's been a year since I started taking fitness seriously in my life and I can't stress enough how helpful it was. **A sound mind lies in a sound body** It helped me to fight my [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury), get into the best shape of my life, made me realize the value of healthy eating.


Meanwhile, I have my fair share of injuries during this journey. Injured my lower back due to a faulty deadlift session, overtrained shoulder because of frequent bouldering sessions. So, I took a step back and realized that flexibility and organized workout is the key for a long running athletic life. Currently, I train around 3 times in the gym, 1 bouldering session, 2 salsa sessions per week with ample amount of time in between to recover.

Here are some audacious goals for this year in terms of fitness.

> * Reach bouldering level to v6/7
> * Reach to advanced salsa level

For folks who do not know Bouldering, here you go [Bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering). Best thing I have picked up this year.


## Objective 4: Begin the adventures of storytelling

Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with storytelling. I still remember the days when my mom / grandma used to tell me all kinds of interesting stories. This planted the seed for my imaginations and it has grown into a sapling. I think it's time that I share all these amazing stories which i gathered so far with people all around the world. I am so psyched about this.


* Perform a storytelling night in Amsterdam ( preferably mezrab)
* Write. Just write
    * one short story (0.3)
    * one long story (0.7)
    * two long stories (1.0)



## Objective 5: Experience the world instead of just traveling

After traveling to almost 15 countries around the world, I have realized that a castle which is built in 1550 won't give me thrill compared to going on a long hike in an unknown trail with locals and best friends. I prefer experiences to city hopping. I prefere adventurous stuff to a relaxing day at the beach. This year marks the beginning of a new way to experience the world.

* Climb [Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) in Japan
* Tandem skydiving
* Boulder in every city wherever it's possible

<br></br>

I know it's quite exhaustive but this will keep me busy and my life fulfilling. I am having the **best time of my life** and I would like to savor each moment while it lasts. After all, we all got one life to live and I want to live it to the fullest.

One of my favourite programming language is [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and I can't think of a better way of starting my blog with a simple hello world program written in it.

    print("Hello, World!")

Such elegant. Almost human readable yet computers can clearly understand them without any problem. Now, let's try the same hello world program in another favourite language of mine [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

Seems a bit more complex when compared to the first one but both does the same job. They both have their own pros and cons and clearly justifies their existence. 

When people ask me why I love programming so much, it's because of the above expressiveness. It's like art. An artist can paint a single picture in thousands of variations without changing the original intention. The same applies to programming.

I love solving interesting and challenging problems in different fields and programming a computer is my swiss army knife to accomplish that. It provides me tools to convert my thoughts and ideas into actions and produce conceivable results.

I am gonna leave you with another version of hello world program written in an esoteric language known as [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

    +[-[<<[+[--->]-[<<<]]]>>>-]>-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-.

Now, you know why it's called Brainfuck ;)

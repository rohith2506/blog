Hello, I am Rohith and welcome to my little corner in the web.

I have procrastinated quite long enough and finally decided to convert my thoughts into words and share with the world.

This blog will be a mix of technical and non technical posts ranging from topics like computer science, artificial intelligence to philosophy and fitness in no particular order.
